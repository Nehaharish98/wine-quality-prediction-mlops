## üéØ Problem Description

**Wine quality** plays a crucial role in ensuring economic value and consumer satisfaction in the wine industry. Predicting wine quality based on physicochemical properties helps producers optimize fermentation processes and make informed decisions about production quality control.

Challenges include:

- Accurately modeling multi-class classification of wine quality scores (3-9).  
- Automating the full machine learning lifecycle from raw data ingestion to deployment and continuous monitoring.  
- Providing actionable insights to stakeholders for improving wine quality.

**Our Solution** is a fully automated MLOps pipeline that predicts wine quality using physicochemical features, integrated with modern tools for reproducibility, deployment, monitoring, and workflow orchestration.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is designed as a **production-ready MLOps pipeline** including:  

- Automated data ingestion, preprocessing, and feature engineering using DVC and custom scripts.  
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking using MLflow.  
- FastAPI for model serving and a user-friendly Streamlit UI for interactive inference.  
- Prefect for workflow orchestration and scheduling of training and monitoring.  
- Comprehensive monitoring setup with Evidently for data drift detection and Grafana for visualization dashboards.  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ready for cloud or local deployment with Docker and Terraform.
